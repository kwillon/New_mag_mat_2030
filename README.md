# New_mag_mat_2030

Develop a generative model capable of projecting stable crystalline structures of magnetic materials with high probability of successful synthesis and given properties. The approach is oriented to reverse design (inverse design), where the algorithm passes from the desired characteristics of the material to the proposal of the perfect crystalline structures.
